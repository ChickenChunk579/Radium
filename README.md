# Radium Engine
A little game engine I have been working on for about a month.

### Using:
- wgpu-native
- SDL2
- SDL2_image
- SDL2_ttf
- spdlog
- lua
- imgui

### Supported Platforms:
- Linux (most supported)
- MacOS (most supported)
- Windows (2nd most supported)
- Web (quite buggy)
- Android (Works but without ImGui)
- iOS (Manual asset moving needed, but more or less works, only tested on simulator)

Built on top of my rendering library called Rune
